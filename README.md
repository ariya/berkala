Berkala runs scheduled tasks specified in a YAML-based configuration.

To get started, first download the binary for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ariya/berkala/releases). Unpack the ZIP file and run the executable.

Since a config file does not exist yet, you will be offered to create one.
Simply accept it and `berkala.yml` will be created, which may look like the following:

```yml
tasks:

  # Without an explicit interval, the task runs immediately
  boot:
    type: notify
    message: Berkala starts now

  # We need to stay hydrated
  hourly-ping:
    type: print
    interval: every 1 hour
    message: Drink some water!

  lunch-reminder:
    type: notify
    interval: at 11:58am
    title: Important reminder
    message: It's lunch time very soon

  weekend-exercise:
    type: notify
    cron: 0 9 * * 6  # every 9 morning on Saturday
    title: Stay healthy
    message: Time for some exercises!
```

The schedule for each task can be specified either with a human-friendly interval (e.g. `every 5 minutes`, `at 5pm`) or a cron expression (refer to [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) for more details). If neither is explicitly stated, then the task runs right away.

As of now, only the following types of tasks are available:

* `print`: displays a message to the standard output
* `notify`: sends a desktop notification

Just like any regular YAML, everything from the `#` character until the end of the line will be ignored. Use this to insert comments.
